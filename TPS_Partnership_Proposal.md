# CosmoNFT Partnership Proposal
## The Planetary Society Strategic Partnership

---

## Executive Summary

CosmoNFT is a digital collectibles platform offering NFTs of celestial objects—stars, exoplanets, galaxies, and nebulae—with a mission to fund space exploration and education. We propose a strategic partnership with The Planetary Society (TPS) wherein **30% of all primary sales revenue and secondary market royalties** will be donated directly to TPS to support its mission of advancing space science and exploration.

This partnership represents a unique opportunity for TPS to engage a new generation of space enthusiasts while generating sustainable, recurring revenue through an innovative digital platform.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 What is CosmoNFT?

CosmoNFT is a curated marketplace for digital collectibles representing real celestial objects. Each NFT is:

- **Scientifically Grounded**: Based on actual astronomical data and discoveries
- **Uniquely Scored**: Rated on a proprietary "Cosmic Score" system (0-500 points)
- **Dynamically Priced**: Prices increase 7.5% weekly across 81 pricing phases
- **Blockchain Verified**: Minted on the Polygon network for low fees and environmental sustainability

### 1.2 The Cosmic Score System

Each celestial object is evaluated across five categories (0-100 points each):

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Fame & Visibility | Public recognition and naked-eye visibility |
| Scientific Significance | Research importance and discoveries enabled |
| Rarity | Uniqueness of the object type or characteristics |
| Discovery Recency | How recently the object was discovered/studied |
| Cultural Impact | Historical and cultural significance |

**Badge Tiers:**
- **ELITE** (425-500): Exceptional celestial objects
- **PREMIUM** (400-424): Highly significant objects
- **EXCEPTIONAL** (375-399): Notable discoveries
- **STANDARD** (350-374): Fascinating cosmic objects

### 1.3 Pricing Structure

| Phase | Duration | Base Price | NFTs Available |
|-------|----------|------------|----------------|
| Phase 1 | 4 weeks | $350 | 1,000 |
| Phases 2-81 | 1 week each | +7.5% per phase | 250 each |

**Example Price Progression:**
- Phase 1: $350
- Phase 10: $658
